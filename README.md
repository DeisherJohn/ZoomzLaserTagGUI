# ZoomzLaserTagGUI

Repository for Zoomz Laser Tag UI program
-------------

<b>Overview</b>: This program is designed to interface with tactical laser tag systems that use XBee radio modules to communicate. For this program to work a XBee module of the same series as the equipment will be needed. It will have to be programmed prior to using this application to ensure it is using the same settings as the equipment. Also a TI CMK2052 sniffing module will be needed.
